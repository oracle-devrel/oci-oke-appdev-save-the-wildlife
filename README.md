Thank you for choosing DevLive-Save-the-Wildlife! This workshop is a valuable opportunity to enhance your cloud computing skills and learn how to build and deploy multiplayer mini game in the Cloud. 

Three.js is a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in web browsers, and there are other options available, such as Babylon.js and A-Frame. The principles of 3D graphics and animation are transferable between these libraries, and the backend and concurrency management principles that are essential for Metaverse applications and Games are also applicable across all three libraries. 

With Three.js and Cloud Native on Oracle Cloud, you can create engaging Metaverse applications for your customers, employees, and partners. Whether it's virtual showrooms, immersive training simulations, product demonstrations, or games, Three.js and Cloud Native on Oracle Cloud provide the scalability, performance, and availability you need to succeed in Metaverse and Gaming.

Part 1 of this workshop will focus on Three.js, but we will cover other options in the future.

Estimated Lab Time: 60 minutes
